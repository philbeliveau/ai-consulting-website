## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-26

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**CRITICAL FAILURE: No Implementation Found**

This story shows zero implementation progress despite being marked for review. All acceptance criteria remain unchecked, and no code has been written. The `/formation-architecte` page does not exist, creating a broken user experience from the existing navigation links in FormationCards component.

**Risk Level: HIGH** - This represents a complete delivery failure that impacts user experience and business objectives.

### Refactoring Performed

**No refactoring possible** - No implementation exists to refactor. 

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: **❌ FAIL** - No code exists to evaluate
- Project Structure: **❌ FAIL** - Missing required page structure 
- Testing Strategy: **❌ FAIL** - No tests exist
- All ACs Met: **❌ FAIL** - 0 of 5 acceptance criteria completed

### Improvements Checklist

### Recommended Status

**❌ Changes Required - COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION NEEDED**

This story cannot proceed to "Done" status. A complete implementation is required before any meaningful quality assessment can be performed. The current state represents a delivery failure that impacts user experience and business objectives.

**Next Steps:**
1. Development team must implement all acceptance criteria
2. Complete test coverage must be added
3. Security and performance requirements must be addressed
4. Full QA review required after implementation
