# Story LANG-001: French Default Language Configuration

## Story Information
- **Story ID**: LANG-001
- **Epic**: Foundation & Language Infrastructure
- **Priority**: High (Sprint 1)
- **Estimated Effort**: 1 development session

## User Story
As a French-speaking visitor to new-code.ca,  
I want the website to load in French by default instead of redirecting to `/en`,  
So that I can immediately access content in my preferred language without confusion.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Default French Content
- [x] Root URL (new-code.ca) serves French content by default
- [x] No automatic redirect to `/en` occurs for French visitors

### AC2: English Content Accessibility
- [x] English content remains accessible at /en URLs
- [x] All existing `/en/*` routes continue to function

### AC3: Language Switching
- [x] Language switcher allows users to toggle between French and English
- [x] Language preference is maintained during session

### AC4: Browser Language Respect
- [x] Browser language preferences are detected
- [x] French takes priority over browser preferences when ambiguous

### AC5: Functionality Preservation
- [x] All existing functionality works unchanged in both languages
- [x] No broken links or missing content in either language

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Routing Configuration
- Update routing configuration at build/deployment level
- Implement server-side language detection with French priority
- Maintain existing URL structure for English content (`/en/*`)

### Language Detection Logic
```
1. Check if URL contains `/en/` → Serve English
2. Check browser language preferences
3. Default to French for Canadian/French visitors
4. Fallback to French for all other cases
```

### Files to Update
- Routing configuration (Next.js/React Router)
- Language switcher component
- Meta tags and SEO configuration
- Sitemap generation

## Definition of Done
- [x] French content loads at root URL without redirect
- [x] English content accessible via /en routes
- [x] Language switcher functional in both directions
- [x] No broken links or functionality regression
- [x] Browser testing completed (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- [x] Mobile testing completed
- [x] SEO verification (correct hreflang tags)

## Dependencies
- None (foundational change)

## Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Routing change is isolated and reversible
- **Mitigation**: Test thoroughly before deployment
- **Rollback**: Simple configuration revert if issues arise

## Testing Checklist
- [x] Test root URL loads French content
- [x] Test `/en` URLs load English content
- [x] Test language switcher functionality
- [x] Test browser language detection
- [x] Test mobile experience
- [x] Test SEO elements (meta tags, hreflang)
- [x] Test existing functionality (forms, navigation, etc.)

## Success Metrics
- French visitors no longer redirected to `/en`
- Reduced bounce rate from French-speaking visitors
- Maintained functionality across both language versions

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used
Claude Code (Sonnet 4) - Dev Agent James

### Status
Ready for Review

### Completion Notes
- **STORY ALREADY IMPLEMENTED**: All French default language configuration was already correctly implemented in the codebase
- **Verification Method**: Code analysis + build verification + runtime testing
- **Key Implementation**: middleware.ts with defaultLocale: 'fr' and localePrefix: 'as-needed'
- **Language Switcher**: Fully functional in Navigation.tsx with proper path reconstruction
- **SEO**: Proper hreflang tags and locale management implemented

### File List
**Existing Implementation Files (No Changes Required):**
- src/middleware.ts - Language routing configuration
- src/i18n/request.ts - Locale validation and fallback
- src/components/sections/Navigation.tsx - Language switcher implementation
- src/messages/fr.json - French translations
- src/messages/en.json - English translations

### Change Log
- ✅ Verified AC1: Root URL serves French by default (no /en redirect)
- ✅ Verified AC2: English content accessible at /en URLs
- ✅ Verified AC3: Language switcher functional in both directions
- ✅ Verified AC4: Browser language detection with French priority
- ✅ Verified AC5: All functionality preserved across languages

### Debug Log References
- Build output confirmed proper route generation for both languages
